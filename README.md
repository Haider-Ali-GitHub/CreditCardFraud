# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions from credit card data. It aims to provide a robust solution that can be integrated into financial systems for real-time fraud prevention.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards, where each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Due to confidentiality, the features are transformed using PCA, with 'Amount' and 'Class' as the only original features.

## Machine Learning Models
Several models have been trained and evaluated:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What you need to install the software:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
